# Some actions are always IO-intensive but require little compute. It's wasteful to put the output
# in the remote cache, it just saturates the network and fills the cache storage causing earlier
# evictions. It's also not worth sending them for remote execution.
# For actions like PackageTar it's usually faster to just re-run the work locally every time.
# You'll have to look at an execution log to figure out what other action mnemonics you care about.
# In some cases you may need to patch rulesets to add a mnemonic to actions that don't have one.
